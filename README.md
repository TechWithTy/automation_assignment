If you would like to run the script yourself click ```open in colab``` and follow the instructions.

Programming backend development in Google Colab can be useful for several reasons:

1. Cloud-based environment: Google Colab provides a cloud-based environment where developers can write, run, and debug code without the need for local installations of development tools or software. This can be particularly useful for backend development, which often requires large amounts of computational resources.
2. Collaboration: Google Colab allows developers to share notebooks and collaborate with other team members in real-time, making it easier to work together on backend development projects.
3. Version control: Google Colab notebooks can be integrated with version control systems like GitHub, making it easier to manage and track changes to code.
4. Data analysis: Google Colab supports a variety of data analysis and machine learning libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow, making it easier to process and analyze data for backend development projects.
5. Accessibility: Google Colab is free to use and accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, making it a convenient option for developers who may not have access to powerful local hardware or development tools.

Overall, programming backend development in Google Colab can provide a convenient, collaborative, and accessible environment for developers to write, test, and deploy backend code.

1. Agile Methodology: This approach emphasizes iterative development, collaboration between team members, and continuous delivery of working software. It prioritizes user feedback and ensures that the code meets the needs of the end-users.
2. Test-Driven Development (TDD): This approach involves writing tests before writing the code. It helps ensure that the code meets the requirements and is easy to maintain. TDD also encourages modular and decoupled code.
3. Design Patterns: Design patterns provide reusable solutions to common software development problems. They help create maintainable, scalable, and efficient code by separating concerns and creating a flexible architecture.
4. Code Reviews: Code reviews involve reviewing code by other team members to identify potential issues and ensure that the code follows best practices. It helps catch errors and promotes a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement.
5. Clean Code: Writing clean code means following best practices for naming conventions, code formatting, and creating readable and maintainable code. This approach emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and clarity.
6. Refactoring: Refactoring involves improving the code structure without changing the behavior. It helps eliminate technical debt and ensures that the code remains maintainable over time.

## Terminologies

Add any unfamiliar or domain specific words with their definitions here.

- DRY**: Do Not Repeat Yourself**
- Scientific Method
1. Observation: The first step of the scientific method is to make observations about a particular phenomenon or problem. This can involve using the five senses or measuring tools to collect data.
2. Question: After making observations, the next step is to develop a question or problem statement based on those observations. The question should be clear, specific, and testable.
3. Hypothesis: A hypothesis is a tentative explanation for the problem or question. It should be based on prior knowledge, observations, and scientific theory.
4. Prediction: After developing a hypothesis, the next step is to make predictions about what should happen if the hypothesis is true. These predictions should be testable and measurable.
5. Experimentation: The next step is to design and carry out an experiment to test the hypothesis. The experiment should be designed to control all variables except for the one being tested.
6. Analysis: After collecting data from the experiment, the next step is to analyze the data and determine if the results support or refute the hypothesis. This can involve statistical analysis, visualizing the data, or using other analytical methods.
7. Conclusion: Based on the results of the analysis, draw a conclusion about the hypothesis. If the hypothesis is supported by the data, it can be accepted. If the hypothesis is not supported by the data, it should be revised or rejected.
8. Communication: The final step is to communicate the results and conclusions to the scientific community through scientific publications, presentations, or other means.
